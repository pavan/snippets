This is a repository where I plan to check in useful or useless code that seems to be interesting.
I run a blog https://pavangpd.blog where I posted some code-experiments ala thought-experiments.
This repositiory will have some such code snippets along with others I find interesting.

If you wish to conatact me to discuss about any of these code snippets please feel free to drop an
email at pgunupudi@gmail.com
